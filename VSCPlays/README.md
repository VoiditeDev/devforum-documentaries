yes, I am VSCPlays writing this, but I have to explain why I am a bad person

# 1. Making very bad topics

### Gender Games

I usually hate talking about gender, but I made a [topic](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/2810350/) about the rise of gender games in Roblox, which I regret making a topic about, and these games exist for years and the "BOYS ONLY, NO GIRLS ALLOWED" isn't that discrimatory

but I am not really a roblox veteran so I can't say anything about that

and it is talking about the poorly made games with AI-Generated photos and those taken off of google, but let's not forget that some random trendy spam games exist...

## Plugin Ideas

I made a [plugin ideas topic](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/2307980) a while ago, but most people were crying over the price which wasn't the final product instead of providing the actual idea, if you don't like the price then don't buy it, simple enough
